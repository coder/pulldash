## Why Not GitHub's Web UI?

GitHub's PR interface works, but it wasn't built for speed:

| Issue                   | GitHub Web                    | Pulldash                            |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Large PRs**           | Truncates diffs, loads slowly | ✓ Renders everything, stays smooth  |
| **Keyboard navigation** | Limited shortcuts             | ✓ Full keyboard-driven workflow     |
| **Multi-file review**   | Constant page loads           | ✓ Instant tab switching             |
| **Context switching**   | Browser tabs everywhere       | ✓ Dedicated app, focused experience |

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action          | Shortcut           |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Command palette | `⌘K` or `⌘P`       |
| Switch tabs     | `⌘1` - `⌘9`        |
| Close tab       | `⌘W`               |
| Navigate files  | `↑` `↓` in palette |
